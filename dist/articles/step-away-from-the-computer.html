<p>Opening Question: When was the last time you thought hard about something for</p>

<li>over the course of a month?</li>

<p>&quot;Key Note&quot; talk by Rich Hickey focussing on the problem solving aspect of programming, which in his experience is influenced and successful due to a lot of thinking without the computer at hand.</p>
<p>He starts out with the well-established data point that bugs are most costly when they have to fixed in production and that it would be preferable to fix them during development.<br>
Then he goes backwards one step further and suggest that bugs are least expensive to prevent in the <em>design</em> of the software.<br>
Relating to this, it is his understanding that &quot;the biggest problems in software are problems of misconceptions&quot;. When not the actual problems at hand are solved, but rather an attempt is made at solving perceived problems or problems arising solely from the suggested &quot;solution&quot;.</p>
<p>Another interesting section was about tradeoffs, a word often used to justify a rushed or not fully tested implementation. According to Hickey a real tradeoff requires at least 2 possible solutions, which are then weighed and, finally, one is picked. Once you made a tradeoff, he suggests to record your reasoning and the decision in writing.</p>
<p>The major problem this talk focuses on, going back to the opening question, is that not enough <em>thought</em> is put into the problem solving aspect of software development (which after all is the whole purpose of writing programs commercially).</p>
<p>Speaking of the mind Hickey starts out describing it as two parts: the &quot;Waking Brain&quot; and the &quot;Background Brain&quot;. According to Hickey the first one is very tactical, while the second one is strategical, abstracts, has a great ability to synthesize. Unfortunately the &quot;Background Brain&quot; can't be used directly, but rather will work on what is most prominent in the &quot;Waking Brain&quot;. The way to get the &quot;Background Brain&quot; to work on what one desires, is to &quot;load it up&quot;.</p>
<p>In order to do this, one foremost has to be aware that the &quot;Background Brain&quot; can only work on 7±2 problems. So how does one deal with designs that have more than 9 parts? According to Hickey a limited subset of problems should be picked and focused on those.<br>
Once the problems to be uploaded are picked, the currently proposed solution (from the &quot;Waking Brain&quot;) should be written down.</p>
<p>Then one should go over the picked problems in varying orders.</p>
<p>With all this preparation done, now the hammock comes into play. This &quot;mind's eye time&quot; — lying down with your eyes closed and thinking uninterruptedly — is an integral part of the process.</p>
<p>Whenever you &quot;hear back&quot; from your &quot;Background Brain&quot;, depending on the situation you might want to act on it immediately, or just take note of the proposed solution. Preferably in writing.</p>
