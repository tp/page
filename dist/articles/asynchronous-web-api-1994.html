<p>After going down a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15898919">Hacker News</a> initiated rabbit hole, I crossed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxQw4CdxLr8">Donald Knuth’s 2017 Christmas Lecture</a> and from there ended up on the <a href="http://oeis.org/">Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences</a>.</p>
<p>For every integer sequence you provide, it lists the known occurrences and, if available, formulae that can be used to generate them.</p>
<p>One interesting detail is, that every page still had a “generated in <em>N</em> seconds” footer, where <em>N</em> often was &gt; 5s for my test queries. So it seems like searching 295.000 possible sequences still takes a little computing time, even on modern hardware.</p>
<p>But while getting an answer on modern hardware in a few seconds is acceptable, let’s image how much longer this might’ve taken a few year back.</p>
<p>In order to offer advanced searches and explain sequences a new service was established in 1994: <a href="http://oeis.org/ol.html">“Superseeker”</a>. As this services does some “serious computing”, we can take a guess at how much longer it must’ve taken to complete a query.</p>
<p>So in order to offer this at that time (where homes still had per-minute dial-up), the search API was implemented  on top of plain e-mail.</p>
<p>That way the server could take as long as it needed to generate a response, and the sender would be notified as soon as possible once the calculation was done. What a beautifully simple approach.</p>
<hr>
<p>Software based on the original bunch of shell scripts from back then is still in use and it’s source code is available <a href="http://oeis.org/ol_source.txt">here</a>.</p>
